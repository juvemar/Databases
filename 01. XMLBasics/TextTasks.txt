1. What does the XML language represents? What does it used for?

 - Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules
 for encoding documents in a format which is both human-readable and
 machine-readable. It is defined by the W3C's XML 1.0 Specification and by
 several other related specifications, all of which are free open standards.
 The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality and usability across the
 Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for
 different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents,
 it is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as
 those used in web services. Several schema systems exist to aid in the 
 definition of XML-based languages, while many application programming interfaces (APIs) have been developed to
 aid the processing of XML data.
 
3. What does the namespaces represents in the XML documents? What are they used for?
 
 - XML Namespace is a mechanism to avoid name conflicts by differentiating
 elements or attributes within an XML document that may have identical names,
 but different definitions. We will be covering the basics of namespace,
 including declaration methods, scope, attribute namespace, and default
 namespace. Namespace is one of the more difficult areas of XML, but it is 
 required knowledge for passing the Basic V2 Exam, and programmers, as well
 as exam candidates, need to obtain a solid understanding of the concepts.
